Awesome! Here’s a simple step-by-step exercise to help you get comfortable with Vi.  

### **Exercise 1: Opening and Editing a File**
1. Open a terminal and create a new file with:  
   ```bash
   vi myfile.txt
   ```
   You’ll see a blank screen or an existing file if `myfile.txt` already exists.

2. Press `i` to enter **insert mode**, then type the following text:
   ```
   Hello, this is my first Vi practice file!
   Learning Vi is fun.
   ```

3. Press `Esc` to exit **insert mode**.
